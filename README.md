## What is Application Proxy?

Application Proxy is a feature of Azure AD that enables users to access on-premises web applications from a remote client. Application Proxy includes both the Application Proxy service which runs in the cloud, and the Application Proxy connector which runs on an on-premises server. Azure AD, the Application Proxy service, and the Application Proxy connector work together to securely pass the user sign-on token from Azure AD to the web application.
